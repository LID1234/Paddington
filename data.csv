Literary Cafe,The Reading Club (popularly known as the 'Literary Café') began as an initiative rooted in the desire to share with others the profoundly traumatic and visceral experience of reading. Because to truly read requires sacrificing the comfort in which we come to self-indulge and demands an exercise of sharpening the mind and implies the obligation to sit (sometimes forcefully while sometimes gently) in front of a mirror that shows us as we are. Reading is about us and about who we are... However it is not only that literature does not diagnose us but rather offers itself as a solution to our boring and much-detested routine to the mediocrity and superficiality into which it is so easy to fall; to the pathetic self-pity that seems to have become the motto behind which we hide from the possibility of becoming more than we are. Reading means liberation means the courage to raise our voice and criticize it represents the ability to think for ourselves deeply and to assume what we think. To choose and understand who we really are.,,Instagram: cafeneaualiterara,,2019,
